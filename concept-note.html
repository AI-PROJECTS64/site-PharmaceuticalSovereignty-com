    <!-- 1. STRATEGIC CONTEXT -->
    <section class="card">
      <div class="section-tag">1. Strategic context</div>
      <h2>From medicine shortages to pharmaceutical sovereignty</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        Over recent years, many jurisdictions have experienced <b>recurrent
        shortages of critical medicines</b>: antibiotics, oncology drugs, sterile
        injectables, anaesthetics and other products essential to basic care. These
        shortages have multiple causes, including:
      </p>
      <div class="list">
        <div class="chip">
          <b>High geographic concentration</b> of manufacturing capacity for active
          pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and finished products.
        </div>
        <div class="chip">
          <b>Thin margins and limited redundancy</b> in globalised supply chains,
          which reduce incentives to invest in spare capacity or buffer stocks.
        </div>
        <div class="chip">
          <b>Procurement practices</b> focused on lowest unit price, with limited
          weight given to resilience, diversification and quality of supply.
        </div>
        <div class="chip">
          <b>Regulatory and logistical bottlenecks</b> that delay switches of
          suppliers or ramp-up of alternative production when disruptions occur.
        </div>
      </div>
      <p class="muted">
        In response, policy debates have increasingly referred to
        <b>“pharmaceutical sovereignty”</b> and to specific programmes on
        <b>critical medicines</b>. The term typically refers to the capacity of a
        jurisdiction or group of jurisdictions to <b>secure continuous access to
        key medicines</b>, without relying excessively on a small number of distant
        suppliers.
      </p>
      <p class="muted">
        A neutral banner such as <b>PharmaceuticalSovereignty.com</b> can help
        structure these debates in a way that is accessible to decision-makers and
        the public, without being tied to any single actor or policy proposal.

    <!-- 2. DESCRIPTIVE VIEW -->
    <section class="card">
      <div class="section-tag">2. Descriptive view</div>
      <h2>What “pharmaceutical sovereignty” can cover</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        Without endorsing any specific legal definition, the expression
        <b>“pharmaceutical sovereignty”</b> can be used descriptively to cover at
        least four complementary dimensions:
      </p>
      <div class="list">
        <div class="chip">
          <b>Critical medicines and priority lists:</b> identifying molecules,
          therapeutic classes and formulations that are essential for basic
          healthcare and for which interruptions of supply have disproportionate
          consequences.
        </div>
        <div class="chip">
          <b>Manufacturing capacity and capabilities:</b> assessing where APIs,
          intermediates and finished products are produced, and which capacities
          exist within a region, including sterile, complex or specialised
          facilities.
        </div>
        <div class="chip">
          <b>Supply chain transparency and monitoring:</b> improving visibility on
          dependencies, bottlenecks, lead times, single points of failure and
          quality issues across the chain, from APIs to distribution.
        </div>
        <div class="chip">
          <b>Procurement design and incentives:</b> aligning tender criteria,
          contracts and reimbursement rules with resilience goals, including
          diversification, strategic reserves and long-term partnerships.
        </div>
      </div>
      <p class="muted">
        A descriptive domain such as <b>PharmaceuticalSovereignty.com</b> does not
        prescribe particular policy instruments. It provides a semantic space in
        which policy makers, industry, payers and civil society can articulate
        their own frameworks, metrics and trade-offs.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 3. FRAMEWORK PILLARS -->
    <section class="card">
      <div class="section-tag">3. A simple four-pillar framework</div>
      <h2>Manufacturing capacity, supply chains, procurement, partnerships</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        For explanatory purposes, pharmaceutical sovereignty initiatives can be
        described along four simple pillars. These pillars are indicative and do
        not reflect any formal standard.
      </p>

      <h3>3.1 Manufacturing capacity</h3>
      <div class="list">
        <div class="chip">
          Mapping and, where necessary, reinforcing regional capacity to produce
          APIs, key intermediates and finished products for critical medicines.
        </div>
        <div class="chip">
          Supporting investments in flexible and quality-assured facilities capable
          of switching between priority molecules when needed.
        </div>
      </div>

      <h3>3.2 Supply chain transparency and monitoring</h3>
      <div class="list">
        <div class="chip">
          Gathering reliable information on suppliers, sub-suppliers, transport
          routes and inventory levels relevant to critical medicines.
        </div>
        <div class="chip">
          Using early-warning indicators and agreed escalation processes when
          shortages or quality problems are detected.
        </div>
      </div>

      <h3>3.3 Procurement design</h3>
      <div class="list">
        <div class="chip">
          Incorporating resilience-related criteria in tenders and contracts, such
          as diversification of sources, buffer stocks or obligations to notify
          disruptions.
        </div>
        <div class="chip">
          Exploring collaborative or joint procurement mechanisms where they can
          strengthen bargaining power while ensuring supply security.
        </div>
      </div>

      <h3>3.4 Strategic partnerships</h3>
      <div class="list">
        <div class="chip">
          Encouraging long-term partnerships between authorities, payers and
          manufacturers to secure sustainable production of low-margin but critical
          medicines.
        </div>
        <div class="chip">
          Coordinating with international partners on transparency, quality
          standards and crisis response.
        </div>
      </div>

      <p class="muted">
        A future initiative under the <b>PharmaceuticalSovereignty.com</b> banner
        could choose a different taxonomy. The purpose of this Concept Note is only
        to illustrate how the term can help organise discussions around concrete
        policy levers.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 4. POLICY DEVELOPMENTS -->
    <section class="card">
      <div class="section-tag">4. Policy developments</div>
      <h2>Critical medicines initiatives and legislative packages</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        Several jurisdictions have launched <b>critical medicines initiatives</b>
        and are reviewing their pharmaceutical legislation to address chronic
        shortages and concentration risks. Common elements across these debates
        include:
      </p>
      <div class="list">
        <div class="chip">
          Establishing and updating <b>lists of critical medicines</b> for which
          supply security is a priority.
        </div>
        <div class="chip">
          Creating <b>alliances or platforms</b> that bring together authorities,
          industry and other stakeholders to propose measures and monitor progress.
        </div>
        <div class="chip">
          Adjusting <b>regulatory and procurement frameworks</b> to reward
          resilience investments and enable faster responses when strains emerge.
        </div>
        <div class="chip">
          Considering <b>strategic projects and public-private partnerships</b>
          aimed at re-shoring or diversifying manufacturing of critical medicines
          and APIs.
        </div>
      </div>
      <p class="muted">
        PharmaceuticalSovereignty.com does not speak on behalf of any of these
        initiatives. It can, however, serve as a descriptive umbrella under which
        future legitimate stewards may explain and connect them.

        <div class="chip">
          <b>Hybrid models:</b> combinations of the above, for example an
